This git repository contains the source code for "E-RentingSystem", a web-based application using MEAN Stack technology that allows customers to register and reserve cars online and for the company to effectively manage their car rental business. The objective of this project is to transform the manual process of renting a car to an online and computerized system, providing a user-friendly and easily understandable GUI to manage the details of car, booking, and car status.

The application is built using MEAN Stack, a popular combination of MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js technologies. The code is organized into modular components for ease of maintenance and extensibility. The system uses a relational database to store all relevant data, including information about car owner, customer, cars, bookings, and car status.

The application features a responsive user interface that allows customers to browse available cars, view car details, and make reservations with just a few clicks. The system also includes administrative features that allow the company to manage car availability, view booking details, and monitor car status.

The repository includes detailed documentation for the application, including a Software Requirement Specification, Software Design Description, and Software Development References. The documentation outlines the project scope, requirements, and design, as well as provides an overview of the system architecture and implementation details.

This project allowed the developer to gain experience in full-stack development and apply their knowledge of database design and implementation. They also gained valuable experience in project planning and management as they worked on this project independently from start to finish.
